# Gait Recognition Project

Overview

This project focuses on gait recognition, the identification of individuals based on their walking patterns. It leverages deep learning models and various architectures such as CNN, VGG16, ResNet, and LSTM. The dataset used is CASIA A, and optimization techniques like dropout, callbacks, and batch normalization are employed to enhance model performance.

Key Features

Gait Recognition using deep learning models
Pre-trained architectures like VGG16 and ResNet
LSTM for sequence prediction tasks
Techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and callbacks for model optimization
Image classification to identify whether a person is present or absent in an image
