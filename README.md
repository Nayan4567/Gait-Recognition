#Gait Recognition Project
##Overview
This project focuses on gait recognitionâ€”the identification of individuals based on their walking patterns. The project uses deep learning models and various architectures like CNN, VGG16, ResNet, and LSTM. The dataset used is CASIA A, and several techniques like dropout, callbacks, and batch normalization are implemented to enhance model performance.

##Key Features
a.Gait Recognition using deep learning models.
b.Pre-trained architectures like VGG16 and ResNet.
c.LSTM for sequence prediction tasks.
d.Techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and callbacks for model optimization.
e.Image classification to identify whether a person is present or absent in an image.
f.Project Structure
g.Data Preprocessing

##Loading and preprocessing the CASIA A dataset.
