#Gait Recognition Project
--Overview
This project focuses on gait recognitionâ€”the identification of individuals based on their walking patterns. It leverages deep learning models and various architectures such as CNN, VGG16, ResNet, and LSTM. The dataset used is CASIA A, and optimization techniques like dropout, callbacks, and batch normalization are employed to enhance model performance.

--.Key Features
--a.Gait Recognition using deep learning models.
--b.Pre-trained architectures like VGG16 and ResNet.
--c.LSTM for sequence prediction tasks.
--d.Techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and callbacks for model optimization.
--e.Image classification to identify whether a person is present or absent in an image.
--f.Project Structure
1. Data Preprocessing
Loading and preprocessing the CASIA A dataset.
Data augmentation techniques (resizing, normalization).
2. Model Development
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction.
Use of pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet).
